A-1 Declarations, Expressions, and Assignments
----------------------------------------------

     

        1   How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?

	ANS :-	 Every  declaration is  displayed on  its own  line as  an independent
            local variable  declaration.When multiple variables are declared and initialized,
	    they are broken  up into simple declarations at the  top and an assignment statement in 
	    the body of the procedure.  There is no  declaration for global  variables; they
            are used directly.For using Z, its value must be loaded to/stored from locals.



        2   How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?

	ANS :- 	  In a GIMPLE file, a statement can have  at the most one operation.  Any expression
            containing  more than  one  operation is  broken  up by  introducing
            temporaries.Temporaries are introduced whenever an operation is
   	    used as an intermediate component of a computation.



        3   How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
            float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?

	ANS :-	 Floats and doubles are represented using scientific notation. An explicit
   cast (larger datatype to lower datatype)is inserted when a float is assigned to an int.




        4   How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?

	ANS :-	 Reading or writing  from a  global  variables  requires  a memory  load
            or  store operation.  As  GIMPLE  statements can  have  at most  one
            operation in a line, A temporary is required for Z = Z + 1 because the result
	    of the computation Z + 1 cannot be written directly to a memory location.
