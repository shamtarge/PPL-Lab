        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?

	ANS:-	 Basic blocks 2,  3 and 4 correspond to the  while-loop while others undergo 
	    a unconditional GoTo. A while loop is  nothing but  a  set  of basic  blocks  with conditional  control
            transfer, the only  notable difference being a jump to  a block that
            has been previously executed (i.e. a backward branch). This is different from the if-else jumps, which always seem
 	    to be conditional.

        2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

	ANS:-	 BB 5:  Outer loop induction variable initialisation
 		 BB 10: Outer loop conditional check
		 BB 6:  Inner loop induction variable initialisation
		 BB 8:  Inner loop conditional check
		 BB 7:  Inner loop body + induction variable increment
		 BB 9:  Outer loop induction variable increment

 		 A  for-loop  is  nothing  but  a  while-loop  with  the  initializer
            at the begining , the  body of  the loop subsequently, the  increment part at the  end of the loop  body, and
            the conditional jump back to the start of the loop.
