        1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
            suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
            have a suffix `(D)'?

	ANS:-	Local variables are  suffixed with a unique  number which represents
            the assignment. For  example, `d_3' refers to the  usage of variable
            `d'  and  the  only  assignment  which reaches  this  point  is  the
            assignment `d_3'.  Variables that are  likely to be used  before any
            assignment are suffixed  with `(D)' to indicate  that the assignment
            was implicit in the declaration.

 

        2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
            to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
            have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
            statements?

	ANS:-	 A PHI merges assignments from different paths and creates a new
            assignment. For example:

                # a_1 = PHI <a_5(3), a_7(4)> 

            indicates that if  the control reaches here from basic  block 3 then
            use the  value of a_5;  otherwise if  the control reaches  here from
            basic block 4 then use the value of a_7.



        3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
            versions of a variable?

	ANS:-	A switch statement can result in a merge of more than two paths (and
            hence possibly more than two assignments).
