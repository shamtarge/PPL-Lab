        1   The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main
            rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why
            is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last
            pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?

	ANS:-	The function body exists as it may be called from another file.
            The compiler cannot know about this before link time.




        2   Is there any way to get rid of it?

	ANS:-	By using "static" keyword in the declaration of function , 
	    the funcion body will disappear if it is not called within the file.
