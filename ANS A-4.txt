        1   How is array declaration and initialization handled?

	ANS :-	In GIMPLE as one operation is allowed in one statement , the array
            initialization is split into  multiple statements that assign values
            to  individual array  elements. This  is to  remain consistent  with
            GIMPLE's one operation per statement policy.



        2   Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
            an intermediate temporary?

	ANS :-	As GIMPLE  can perform only  one operation per statement,  it cannot
            read  and write  to  array  locations at  the  same  time (as  array
            accesses  involve offset  calculation). Thus,  these are  split into
            separate read and write statements by introducing a temporary.


		

        3   Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?

	ANS :-	CLOBBER statements are used for  address-escaped variables.
	    To mark the arrays as invalid at scope exit i.e the  scope  of  this  address-escaped
            variable has ended.
