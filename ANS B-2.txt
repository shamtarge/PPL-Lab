        1   What will happen if "a = a + N" is replaced by "a = a + 1"?

	ANS:-	 The loop will be unrolled and constant propogation will allow GCC to
            compute  the final  value of  `a'. Hence  the loop  will be  removed
            entirely and will turn the function into the equivalent of "return 14".
