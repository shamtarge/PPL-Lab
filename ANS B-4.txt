        1   How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original
            code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?

	ANS :-	The expression is computed twice in the code,but the FRE pass was able
            to  reuse the  temporary variable  which  stored the  result of  the
            intitial computation  of (a +  c). Thus,  one line of  execution was
            saved, and so was the use of an extra variable. 



        2   Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you
            check?

	ANS :-	We can check if there have been further optimisations by checking
 	    B-4.c.*.optimized. If  it is same as the output  of FRE, then no
            more optimizations have occured.



        3   Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if
            "return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?

	ANS :-	If return b is removed then the computations ofvariable b is waste
	   It would result in its elimination as dead code .  If function  `main' is
	   going to "return 0"  and there is no other  output.
